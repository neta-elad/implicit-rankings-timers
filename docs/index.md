# Implicit Rankings with Timers
This is the Python library accompanying the
"*Verifying First-Order Temporal Properties 
of Infinite States Systems via Timers and Rankings*"
paper.
It allows for easy, type-safe definitions of transition systems
and temporal properties,
and constructing proofs using implicit rankings and timers.

## Getting Started
All necessary symbols are re-exported from the [`prelude`](prelude) 
module, so you can start by simply writing:
```python
from prelude import *
```
