# the example discussed with oded that is omega^omega and extensions?

# possible examples from Sound Verification Procedures / Peyras et al. 

# From Proving Termination with Multiset Orderings / Manna & Dershovitz
# actually this is based on one of Dijkstra's notes [1] in the above

# loop until the shunting yard is empty
# select a train
# if the train consists of only a single car
# then remove it from the yard
# else split it into two shorter trains
# fi
# repeat

# Another example from this paper:

# white, red--~ red, white
# blue, red ~ red, blue
# blue, white --~ white, blue.
